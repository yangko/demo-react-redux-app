This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# A Demo of React Redux SPA app using Star Wars REST API (https://swapi.dev/)

[Live Link](https://yangko-react-redux-app.herokuapp.com/)

**Functionalities:** 

- Select character from the dropdown ('Luke Skywalker' as the default).
- Then show a list of movies the character casted.
- Filtering and sorting feature enabled.

I am using **React, Redux**, and Material-UI (for React Design Framework, most concerning about the autocomplete module for the character selection) on the front end and **Express** on the backend.

To run this app:

* `git clone https://github.com/yangko/demo-react-redux-app.git` - Clone this repo
* `cd into_directory` - Access Root Directory
* `npm install` - Install All Dependencies
* `node app.js` - Launch Application Locally   

*Make Sure You Have nodeJs Installed Locally*
