This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# A Demo of SPA (Single Page Application) [React Redux App] 

This is a full-stack app designed to consume the open-table API.

[Live Link](https://yangko-react-restaurant-list.herokuapp.com/)

**Functionalities:** 

Selecting A City To View Available Restaurants And Reserving a Table. Filtering and sorting feature enabled.

I am using **React, Redux**, axios and Material-UI (for React Design Framework, most concerning about the autocomplete module for the city selection) on the front end and **Express** on the backend.

To run this app:

* `git clone https://github.com/yangko/React-Restaurant-List` - Clone this repo
* `cd into_directory` - Access Root Directory
* `npm install` - Install All Dependencies
* `npm start` - Launch Application Locally   

*Make Sure You Have nodeJs Installed Locally*
